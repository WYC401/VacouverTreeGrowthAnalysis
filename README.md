This is the mini data analysis work, which is divided into 3 milestones folder and 1 output folder. Each folder is meant for one split task of data analysis.   


Basically, it is a data analysis using `dplyr`, `ggplot2` and other packages to transform, visualize and analyze the data. More details can be found in the "Mini Data Analysis" part in the [course page](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/course/).
